# Python Utility Scripts

The build tooling relies on a few helper scripts:

- `make_disk.py`: creates the disk image used by QEMU.
- `move_files.py`: stages binaries and resources into the disk image.

For end-to-end build steps, see [BUILD-SYSTEM.md](BUILD-SYSTEM.md), which shows where these scripts are invoked.
