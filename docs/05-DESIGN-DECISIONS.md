# Design Decisions

Key architectural choices and constraints for MYRASPOS:

- **Simplicity over performance**: clear, instructional code is preferred to micro-optimizations.
- **Educational focus**: heavy in-line documentation and straightforward algorithms.
- **Single-core target**: designed for single CPU cores with cooperative task scheduling.
- **Explicit memory model**: see [02-MEMORY-MANAGEMENT.md](02-MEMORY-MANAGEMENT.md) for allocator and MMU rationale.
- **Cross-referenced docs**: use [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) and component pages for detailed rationale tied to each subsystem.
